## Credits
I've collected work from different artists that I edited in GIMP to create the images that can be found in `/resources/images/`. A huge thank you goes to all of them!

The background tile

The roof tiles, and the sails of the wind-mill by [The Chayed - KIIRA](https://opengameart.org/content/200-tileset-legend-of-pocket-monsters), licensed under [CC-BY 3.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/). I just colored them differently and rearranged them in order to form all roofs seen here.

The roads by [chabull](https://opengameart.org/content/ground-tileset-grass-sand), licensed under [CC-BY 3.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/). I added some semi-transparent blurring for the end of the road.

The stone ground tiles by [Marta Nowaczyk](https://opengameart.org/content/stone-brick-wall-background), licensed under [CC-BY 3.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/). I partly transformed them to end smoothly.
